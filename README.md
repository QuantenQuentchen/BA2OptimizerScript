# BA2OptimizerScript
So I just wrote a little Python script dependant on the BSA Browser cli to extract all my small ba2 files, cause bethesda games are at their peak with 800 Mods installed. 
Should work for SSE and any other game that uses bs2 files don't quote me on that tho, currently tested on Fallout4 I and resulted in well, uncompressed Assets.
Will obviously massively increase drive usage...
